BeerCoder
=========

Beer recipe formulation and brewing software for the Chrome runtime.

BeerCoder is a replacement for [BrewSys](https://github.com/frodare/BrewSys).
It uses code and ideas from [jsBrewCalc](https://github.com/frodare/jsBrewCalc) and is built around
the idea of create a brewing software that uses Beer Markup Language ([BML](https://github.com/frodare/beer-markup))
at its core.
